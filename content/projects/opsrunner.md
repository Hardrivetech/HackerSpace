<p><span class="badge">#automation</span> <span class="badge">#runbooks</span> <span class="badge">#cli</span></p>

Declarative runbooks for repeatable operations tasks.

## Overview

OpsRunner executes YAML-defined tasks with variables, secrets, and concurrency controls, enabling consistent automation for development and lab workflows.

## Features

- YAML runbooks with typed variables and conditionals
- Secrets from environment/.env files
- Concurrency, retries, and dry-run
- Notifications (stdout, webhook)

## Stack

- Python, Click, pydantic, rich

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1) Install
pip install opsrunner

# 2) Create a sample runbook
cat > deploy.yml <<'YAML'
steps:
  - name: Build
    run: npm ci && npm run build
  - name: Upload
    run: rclone copy dist remote:site
  - name: Purge cache
    run: curl -X POST https://cdn.example/purge -H "Authorization: $CDN_TOKEN"
YAML

# 3) Run with variables and a token in env
export CDN_TOKEN=...
opsrunner run deploy.yml --var env=staging --dry-run
```

## Usage

```yaml
# deploy.yml
steps:
  - name: Build
    run: npm ci && npm run build
  - name: Upload
    run: rclone copy dist remote:site
  - name: Purge cache
    run: curl -X POST https://cdn.example/purge -H "Authorization: $CDN_TOKEN"
```

```bash
# Run with a variable and .env for secrets
export CDN_TOKEN=...
opsrunner run deploy.yml --var env=staging --dry-run
```

## Status

Alpha â€” schema and CLI may change.

## Roadmap

- SSH inventory and remote execution
- Windows support via WinRM
- GitHub Actions integration and template generator

## Notes

Test in non-production environments first. Handle secrets carefully.
